## For problem 1: to create a data frame.

``` r
# Use 'tibble' to create the data frame.

hw_tbl1 = tibble(norm_samp = rnorm(10),
                 vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
                 vec_char = c("this", "is", "the", "first", "homework", "in", "data", "science", "one", "class"),
                 vec_factor = factor(c("support", "oppose", "neutral", "support", "oppose", "neutral", "neutral", "support", "oppose", "neutral")),
                 )
hw_tbl1
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1   -0.575  FALSE       this     support   
    ##  2   -0.0909 FALSE       is       oppose    
    ##  3    0.0368 TRUE        the      neutral   
    ##  4   -1.60   FALSE       first    support   
    ##  5   -0.456  FALSE       homework oppose    
    ##  6   -0.892  FALSE       in       neutral   
    ##  7    0.440  TRUE        data     neutral   
    ##  8   -0.206  FALSE       science  support   
    ##  9    1.89   TRUE        one      oppose    
    ## 10   -0.401  FALSE       class    neutral

``` r
# Neat step is to take the mean of each variable in my data frame.

mean(pull(hw_tbl1,norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.1858807

``` r
mean(pull(hw_tbl1,vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(hw_tbl1,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_tbl1, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw_tbl1,vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_tbl1, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# The results show that mean function works on the first two vectors, but not on the last two for the reason that they are not numeric or logical. 
```

## Applies ‘as.numeric’ function to the logical, character, and factor variables.

``` r
num_logical = hw_tbl1$vec_logical
as.numeric(num_logical)

num_char = hw_tbl1$vec_char
as.numeric = (num_char)

num_factor = hw_tbl1$vec_factor
as.numeric = (num_factor)

# The logical variables can be changed into numeric, but the character and factor variables cannot. This explains why in the above chunk, the last two vector cannot be taken the mean.
```
